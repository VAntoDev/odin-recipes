    <h2> Description: </h2>

    </p>

    <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
        <li> 200g of cheese </li>
        <li> 150g of tomato's sauce </li>
        <li> 300g of dough </li>
        <li> 2 basil leafs </li>      
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Step 1: Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.        </li>
        <li> Step 2: Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li>
        <li> Step 3: Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li> Step 4: Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>
        <li> Step 5: Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</li>
        <li> Step 6: Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li> Step 7: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li> Step 8: Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.</li>
